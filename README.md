### Hello 👋
First and foremost I am a loving husband and father of 4 children!  I say this first because everything I do in my life is for the building up of my family. They are my heart and soul, my joy, my passion and my fulfillment.

Since high school and the late 90's, wow I just said that...😂, I have entertained quite a few different jobs from fast food 🌮, banking 🏧, and even plumbing 🚽.  Although dabbling in those fields, I spent most of my years since then in the retail and customer service industry.  Even though I spent so many years in unrelated fields, my passion for knowledge and logical problem solving was never quelled.  I have always enjoyed working with computers and the programs within to accomplish different tasks.

Now getting the opportunity to join Boise CodeWorks full stack boot camp has given me a great opportunity and has been a wonderful experience.  It has renewed my love of working my brain to solve complex issues.  I'm looking forward to gaining all the knowledge needed to pursue work within this field that I've found so enjoyable!

- 🌱 I’ve learned: Vue, Node, C#, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS/bootstrap

⚡ Fun facts: 
- Although I used to watch DragonBall Z in the 90's, it was my son who really got me watching more current Anime and I have really enjoyed watching some shows.
- I absolutely love being up in the mountains 🌄, I just wish I had the ability to spend more time in them.
- Ninja Turtles 🐢 and X-MEN were my cartoons of choice growing up.
- Although dabbling on the Commodore 64, I never had the privilage of having a computer in my home until the birth of Windows 3.1.  That's right! In the early 90's was when I was first taught about the command line and how to access the computer from it.
